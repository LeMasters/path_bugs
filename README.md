# path_bugs
A quick overview of how paths can work in GameMaker.

You create paths by doing the following (THIS IS A VERY
GAMEMAKER, VERY FRUSTRATING DANCE.  SORRY ABOUT THAT.  THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.)

1.  In the room layers screen, on the left, create a new PATH LAYER.
2.  Then choose that layer (it will be called Path_1) on the left;
3.  Now go to Path_1 Layer Properties (ALSO ON THE LEFT) and choose "Select Path..." (it is a button):
4.  IN THE RIGHT-HAND PANEL OF THE WINDOW THAT OPENS, CHOOSE "CREATE NEW..."
5.  Now it probably won't take you right to the new path creation window.  If it does, skip to 7 below;
6.  If you didn't go to a new window, go to the ASSET MANAGER on the right of your screen and look for something like "PATH_1", double clickit.
7.  Now you actually have to draw the damn thing.  Honestly, this interface is like Illustrator on cocaine.  It never works quite right, and it always wants to add more points to your path.  Just hang in there and try to draw a short 3 point path, then look at the code I built to assign an object to that path.

Now you're playing with power! ("Now you're playing with power!" is not a trademark slogan owned by me).
